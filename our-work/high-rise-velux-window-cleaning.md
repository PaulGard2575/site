It’s been 8 years since the management company cleaned these windows in a Newcastle high rise block.

We got them looking fantastic again though!

# Velux Window Cleaning

Velux windows are fantastic. They give light in an otherwise dark attic room. But let’s be honest, they’re almost impossible to keep clean. When was the last time yours were cleaned? Have they ever been cleaned? No problem for us!

Our long-reach 65ft (20m) pole will make short work of cleaning any difficult to reach velux windows.

> Our larger poles can reach heights of 40ft and therefore clean velux windows and high-rise windows that are usually difficult to reach!
